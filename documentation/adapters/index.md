# Adapters

As you've seen throughout this documentation none of actions possible are dependent on a storage engine, all his abstracted away.

This allows Formal to offer different storage adapters tailored to some use cases.

This project uses [Property Based Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing) to make sure all the adapters behave the same way. This allows you to switch from one to another safely.
